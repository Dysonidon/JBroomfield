			<p>This is my about page for my CS11010 website project</p>
			
			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p>This webpage development project has been a great learning experience for me. I have had no previous experience with web development and concepts such as CSS are entirely new. I have had previous experiences with programming meaning JavaScript came a lot more naturally to me however, accessing forms from the webpage was also a new idea for me to grasp. These practical’s have allowed me to put the lectures into practice, further consolidating my knowledge of all the basic concepts and syntax. Having my own working web pages that anybody can view allows me to take pride in the work I have put into this and is not only a great demonstration of my skills, but also my ability to learn and grasp new concepts with confidence and ambition. I also now have useful transferable skills I can take away with me and a template of a professional and CSS/HTML5 valid website I can use in my future web development endeavours. These practical’s have sufficiently challenged me and pushed me to achieve my best work and I have thoroughly enjoyed not only the learning process, but the reward of completing my work. I look forward to furthering my web development experience.</p>
